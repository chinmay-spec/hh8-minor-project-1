Attack: Session Hijacking (Cookie Theft)
Method:
1. Logged in as Admin on Browser A.
2. Copied the 'session' cookie value.
3. Opened Browser B (Incognito).
4. Injected the cookie into Browser B.
5. Refreshed page -> Bypassed Login -> Gained Admin Access.

Conclusion: The 'session' cookie is a temporary password. If stolen, MFA/Passwords don't matter.
